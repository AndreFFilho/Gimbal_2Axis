This repository contains the firmware for the embedded system and the supervisory interface for a **2-Axis Gimbal** (Pitch and Roll). The project was developed with a focus on **Real-Time Automation** and **Embedded Systems**, using the **ESP32** microcontroller.

The system combines **Field Oriented Control** (FOC), Sensor Fusion via **Kalman Filter**, and secure IoT communication over **MQTT**.

## 🌟 Firmware Features

* **Real-Time Control:** Deterministic **PID loop** running at **200Hz (5ms)**, prioritized via FreeRTOS.
* **SimpleFOC:** Vector Control (SVPWM) for Brushless motors (BLDC), ensuring smooth motion.
* **Sensor Fusion:** Implemented via **Kalman Filter**.
* **IoT & MQTT:** Telemetry (Angle/Battery) and remote setpoint reception over MQTT with TLS support.
* **Multitasking:** Architecture based on Tasks, Queues, Mutexes and Semaphores to prevent *race conditions*.
* **Reproducible Environment:** Native support for **Docker (Dev Containers)**.

## 🧠 Technical Challenges & Control Strategy

**Overcoming Sensor Latency:**
Initially, the system relied on the MPU6050’s internal Digital Motion Processor (DMP) to obtain pitch and roll angles. However, the DMP introduced processing delays that restricted the control bandwidth. This latency prevented us from increasing the PID gains without pushing the system into instability, resulting in a sluggish motor response. 

To solve this, we bypassed the DMP entirely. By implementing a custom **Kalman Filter** directly on the raw accelerometer and gyroscope data, we drastically reduced latency and increased the sampling rate. This software solution allowed for higher PID gains, yielding a much faster and more aggressive system response.

**Mechanical Resonance & Structural Flexibility:**
During high-frequency operation, we identified a mechanical limitation. The 3D-printed ABS arms exhibited structural flexibility, essentially acting as a mass-spring (second-order) system. When the motors accelerated rapidly to correct large errors, the arms vibrated. While the control loop was robust enough to stabilize the gimbal, this mechanical resonance lowered the overall margin of stability. This highlighted the crucial relationship between rigid mechanical design and high-frequency control loops.

## 🚀 Compilation Guide (Firmware)

### Prerequisites
* **ESP-IDF v5.5.1** (Recommended Version).
* ESP32 USB Driver (CP210x or CH340).

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)
This repository includes a `.devcontainer` configuration. If you are using VS Code:
1.  Install the **Dev Containers** extension.
2.  Open the project folder and click on **"Reopen in Container"**.
3.  The environment will be set up automatically with all necessary tools.
4.  Compile:
    ```bash
    idf.py build
    ```

### Option B: Manual Installation (Native)
1.  Install the ESP-IDF v5.5.1.
2.  Download the SimpleFOC dependency:
    ```bash
    idf.py add-dependency "espressif/esp_simplefoc^1.2.1"
    ```
3.  **Critical Configuration (Kernel):**
    * Execute `idf.py menuconfig`.
    * Navigate to `Component config` → `FreeRTOS` → `Kernel`.
    * Change `configTICK_RATE_HZ` to **1000** (1kHz). *This is essential for the main loop (5ms) to run correctly.*

### Network Configuration (Wi-Fi and MQTT)
⚠️ **Warning:** Security credentials are not version-controlled (ignored by git). Please update the following files before compiling: 

1.  **Wi-Fi:** `main/WIFI_MQTT/wifi_sta.c` (SSID and Password).
2.  **MQTT:** `main/WIFI_MQTT/mqtt_esp32.c` (Broker URI, Username and Password).

### Flashing and Monitoring
Connect the ESP32 via USB and run:
```bash
# Replace COMx with your specific port (e.g., COM3 or /dev/ttyUSB0)
idf.py -p COMx flash monitor
```

## 🖥️ Desktop Interface

The Graphics User Interface (UI) allows you to visualize telemetry data and send control commands. The Python source code is located in the `Interface/` folder.

### Interface Structure

- **`main.py`**: Entry Point. Initializes Flet and MQTT process.
- **`GUI/app.py`**: Builds the UI (Sliders, Charts, Telemetry Cards).
- **`favoritos.xlsx`**: Local storage for saved positions.
- **`MQTT/`**: Communication Module.
  - `config.py`: Broker and Topic Configurations.
  - `cliente.py`: Paho-MQTT Client with debounce logic.
  - `mqtt_process.py`: Background process to prevent GUI freezing.
  - `mqtt_logger.py`: Utility for saving logs to CSV.

### Running the Interface

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ and `pip`.

1.  Navigate to the interface folder:
    ```bash
    cd Interface
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # Windows:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # Linux/Mac:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(requirements.txt content: `flet`, `paho-mqtt`, `openpyxl`)*

4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
